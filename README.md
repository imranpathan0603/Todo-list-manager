# Todo-list-manager
 A fully interactive and persistent Todo List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript   It includes advanced features like drag &amp; drop sorting, persistent dark mode, and localStorage support.

##  Business Logic Workflow

1️⃣ User enters a task → Stored in array & localStorage  
2️⃣ DOM updates the UI immediately  
3️⃣ User actions (edit/delete/complete) update both array & UI  
4️⃣ Drag-drop sorting also updates array and storage  
5️⃣ Reload page → exact same state restored

---

##  Learning Outcomes

✔ Deep understanding of DOM manipulation  
✔ State & UI synchronization  
✔ Local storage usage  
✔ Clean modular architecture  
✔ Event handling (click, input, keydown, drag events)  
✔ Dark mode implementation

##  Future Enhancements

- Search tasks  
- Sort by completed or priority  
- Due date reminders  
- Cloud sync with Backend/Firebase  
- Animations for reorder & delete
- PWA (Installable on phone/desktop)
